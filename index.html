<h2>WWoof</h2> 
<p> 
    It was my first time doing any kind of work exchange program
    but I ended up helping an older couple in tabiona utah, They
    had a geo-thermal greenhouse , chickens, I helped them build 
    an awning, when there nephew came in town I would help him with
    his off grid projects such as building an icehouse, and when I 
    would get bored I would find out what they had to do around town,
    helping people with their animals, small projects like weeding,
    harvesting their garden or other random things they had on their
    property. For some extra cash I would help someone there with their
    concrete buisiness, building foundations, footings, and slabs all
    around town. I really enjoyed my time doing this I made little money
    but did lots of manual labor. The host family I stayed with provides
    room and board and 3 meals, which is all I really need because thats
    basic needs of a human. I plan to try workaway in my next work exchange.
    
    I was randomly thinking I helped a lady rubber band all her goats
    and she gave me 2, I dont ever plan to cash that in but she felt 
    bad for not paying me and that was her gratituity so I said yes.
    Not sure what the hell I would do with a couple goats with my
    lifestyle but ok. 6/12/2024

<h2>Workaway</h2>
<p> I plan to use this program in my next work adventure but unsure where
    to go this time. I plan for out of the state maybe at the beginnng of 
    of next year or sometime early winter. I have been browsing around Alaska 
    but still up in air. It changes everyday of where I want to go but I
    know I need to get out of here but need to do it right so I can stay
    longer term, still proccessing logistics and trying to avoid monthly
    expenses and only have essentials to life and not wordly possessions,
    I need to remember food, water and shelter are my essentials, anything
    else is just extra. Workaway requires 4 hours min a day i can easily
    do that but usually I do more from my experience at wwoof. I may of done
    to much because the expectation became more and they stopped me from going
    to other projects that I would of got paid for, so I have to be careful this
    run and do whats required and a little more, not overkill. 6/12/2024

<h2>Computers</h2>
<p> I have been tinkering around with different self host server things,
    as well as messing around with different distros and think I have landed 
    on Arch Linux. I have been running my media server but havent really 
    watched anything on it, its just fun to have. I have ran into a few problems
    with the bluray's because I need a libre drive, but have a good library 
    of a couple hundred movies I will probably not see much of. I want to 
    get a cheap travel laptop with Arch and my media server, jellyfin on there
    and I should be good to do my workaway program with. I have been
    using older computer crap so I have to do a lot of tinkering and hope
    it works out. I have backups of all my media but nothing else, I should
    not need other thing but should probably back up some my ISO's. I have
    been learning more about how to self host and have been working on
    how to eaily do this and I beleive everyone should be learning all these
    because paying for a cloud server and digital media can be a joke. I 
    lost all my shit I paid for digitally because my emailed got hacked and 
    everything I bought with that email is now gone. 6/12/2024

<h2>Family</h2>
<p> Nothings changed best I stay away for mine and everyone's well-being 6/12/2024

<h2>Rando</h2>
<p> I took a random voice lesson last week, mainly cause I was bored
    and needed to do something random.

<h2>Work</h2>
<p> Working at a dog daycare which is actually a lot more meaningful
    for me then most jobs I have had. Obviously not making as much
    but I tend to consume drugs like no other if I make to much, so
    this is not a bad idea to just make a modest amount and its being 
    deposited into my Dads account, So im not randomly spending on shit
    I dont need either. Any way I really enjoy working with all the dogs
    I can walk around aimlessly without havent to stand or sit in one 
    spot my whole shift so thats nice. Animals are better to work with
    even if they are a problem, and I occasionaly get to drop in the 
    workshops they do. 6/12/2024
<br>
    Just got off my shift 7am-7pm. I do 3 shifts Thursday Friday and 
    Saturday. I work with mostly girls that are 18-26. I thought I 
    would get tired of it real quick but its really not that bad 
    I usually can keep busy doing what needs to get done and if there
    is drama I just keep doing what I was doing. They do go work!
</p>
<br>
<h2>Music</h2>
<p> I find myself listening to a lot of alan walker or instrumental music, 
    probably because I dont get what they are saying until I read the lyrics
    100 times. If I do listen to music with lyrics its usually simple and 
    sometimes cheesy, Im not sure why but whatever 6/12/2024

<h2>For the Horde</h2>
<p> I need to downsize my possessions to essentials only! 6/12/2024
</p>
<h2>Kiribati</h2>
<p>Do I go? 6/12/2024
</p>
<h2>Legal</h2>
<p> Im hoping I get off probation on the 17th. I was suppose to be on for a year 
    but they are going to contact the court since I finished everything including
    classes, fines, and behaviour. 6/12/2024
